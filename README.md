# UE_QueueType_DevEnv

Related to Unreal PR https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pull/8859

Bounded MPMC Queue type(s) re-write, designed to be better than the AtomicQueue presently used in the Unreal Engine.

Currently a work in progress. Everything is contained within one type for easy benchmaring.

Queue type is in Queue.h.
